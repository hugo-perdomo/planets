Cold and dry, but one human here. 

Just saw that there were 2 moons, may be a problem for Wolfman 

The energy of the moons is different to the ones in earth. Maybe is not as big as a problem. 

Even with less energy maybe there is another planet we can explore. Lets move to Venus to see settlement options.
